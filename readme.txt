== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I *have* to weigh myself everyday? =

Nope.  If you skip a day (or 6) your trend will just be calculated based off whenever your last weigh-in was.  Obviously, weighing yourself everyday will give you the most accurate trend.

= What does the sidebar widget do? =

Nothing yet.  Got a good idea?  Let me know.
