Helps you track and predict weight loss using your Wordpress blog.  Daily weight entry, trend calculations, and more.

== Description ==

Want to lose weight?  Need help?  Use Wordpress? (of course you do!)

The Hacker's Diet is a simple way to count calories and track your weight to make sure you are really losing the pounds.  By calculating your average weight, you don't have to be scared of those days when you "gain" 2 pounds overnight.  You'll see exactly your rate of weight loss and be able to predict when you will hit your weight goal.

This plugin serves to provide a web-based version of the Excel spreadsheets provided by the diet plan.  This lets you use the familiar interface of your blog to keep up-to-date on your diet.  After you hit your weight goal, it helps you maintain your weight by keeping you within a set window around your goal.

== Installation ==

1. Extract and upload the contents of the zip file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Click the menu link on the Dashboard home page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I *have* to weigh myself everyday? =

Nope.  If you skip a day (or 6) your trend will just be calculated based off whenever your last weigh-in was.  Obviously, weighing yourself everyday will give you the most accurate trend.

= Can multiple users log their weights? =

Yes! Weight entries are saved per user, so anybody that has access to your blog's dashboard can log their weights.  Note: edit the `$hackdiet_user_level` variable at the top of `hackersdiet.php` to restrict access.

= What does the sidebar widget do? =

Nothing yet.  Got a good idea?  Let me know.

= Why isn't the plugin version 1.0 yet? =

I don't consider my plugin complete until I have a story in place for viewing and editing historical weight entries.  Once I have that, I can consider it "feature complete".
